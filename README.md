This is a UI for an LNBITS wallet that's meant to look like a piggy bank. Children can track their deposits but don't have the ability to withdrawl. It is meant to function like a physical piggy bank and the parents can always go back to the original LNBITS url and withdrawl when a large enough amount of money has been accumulated to place somewhere more secure. There are a few other fun learning links and various real-time stats for the network.

Grab your admin key from an LNBITS wallet and plug it in your environment variables as the value and REACT_APP_X_API_KEY as the key. Then, take a moment to reflect on the fact that I'm accepting no liability for all the money you're going to lose from using this app. Ruminate on it day and night and go on a fast if you don't feel as if you fully appreciate how silly it would be to put any significant amount of money in here. Then, have teaching your kid about Bitcoin and remember that you and only you are the one who will cover their losses if something goes wonky with this software.

Big thanks to plebdevs.com and their plebdev course, where I learned how to make lightning wallets!
